# Internship Assignments

Machine Learning models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest , Support Vector Machine, Clustering models and Deep Learning , Natural Language Processing models are built during intership. 

Recommendation system,Association Rules, Time series models are also created as a part of internship assignments.



EDA and Feature Engineering are performed on all the respective models up to model building with efficient accuracy.Hyper Parameter tuning also performed on few models to enhance accuracy of the models.
